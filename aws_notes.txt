AWS Notes:::

1. Most data is region specific
2. AZ per region can be between 3 or 2 , max 6
3. AZ's are connected to each other with 
   a. High bandwitdth 
   b. Ultra low latency networking

4. IAM is global and does not have region
5. Some services are region specific
6. IAM groups can't contain another group
IAM (Identy and Access Management)
 Users
 Groups
 Roles

 1 IAM user per PHYSICAL PERSON
 1 IAM Role per Application

 Security Group:
 1. Outbound is default ALL
 2. InBound rule default is NONE
 3. Connection refused (means EC2 system or application is not ready)


 Private / Public / Elastic IP
 If you need a fix IP in AWS called Elastic IP (max 5 Elastic possible in AWS account)

 Stop to Start (Will loose Public IP)
 Terminate to start (Not Possible)
 Restart (will keep the Public IP)   

 EC2 Instance::
 1. On Demand - short workload, pridictable price
 2. Reserved (1 yr minimum)
 3. Spot Instance - short workload, cheap, can lose instance
 4. Dedicated Instance - no hardware sharing with other customer
 5. Dedicated Hosts - Book entire physical server

 Instance Type:
 R: Lot of RAM
 C: good CPU
 M: balance (Medium)
 I: Good local i/o
 G: GPU

 MIG-RC

 T2/T3: burstable instance/unlimited
 http://ec2instances.info

 AMI:
 specific to region.
 you can copy to other region

 Copy AMI from billingProduct
 - first start the instance then create ur own AMI from it, direct copy not possible
 - if u share AMI ur still owner of AMI
 - if u copy a shared AMI you become owner of AMI
 - to copy AMI that was shared with you. owner must give u read permission for storage that backs the AMI
   either associated EBS snapshot or S3 bucket
 - u can't copy encrypted AMI shared with u. if underlying snapshot n encrhption key shared with ou j can copy snapshot while re-encrypting it with key of ur own. now you own the copied snapshot, u can register it as new AMI  

EC2 Placement Groups

Cluster: cluster instance same AZ
Spread: Spread instances across underlying hardware - critical applications
Partition: spread instance, same rack within same AZ

Cluster:
1. Great network (10 Gbps bandwidth)
cons: if rack fails, all instances fails - high risk
Use case:
a. big data jobs - complete fast
b. application low latency n high network throughput

SPread:
ec2/hardware instances are low risk failure and spread in diff. AZ 
max 7 instances per spread group
- option available only for high cpu, not for all type of ec2 instance
Usecase: critical apps , high availability app.


Partition:
- upto 7 parititions per AZ
- instances in partition do not share racks with instances in another partitions
- so if instances in partition fails still other partition instances are on (low risk)
Usecase:
HDFS, Hbase, Cassandra, Kafka


Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI)

logical component in VPC that represents virtual network card
ENI has following attributes:
a. Primary private IPv4, one or many secondary IPv4
b. One Elastic IP (IPv4) per private IPv4
c. One public Ipv4
d. one or more security groups
e. MAC address

we can add ENI and attach to ec2 instance
**** ENI is specific to AZ

ENI is helpful when we want EC2 to be available to public using eth0 and security group 80 port
and eth1 to 22 port for other access privately (using new secondary public IP)
it's like same ec2 will behave differently when accessing using diff. public IPs

EC2 Hibernate:
in memory (RAM) is preserved
faster boot time (as OS does not need restart)
Usecase:
a. long running process
b. save RAM state
c. services which takes time to initialize

Hibernate is not supported by all type of ec2 instance
only supported by c3, c4,c5, m3,m4,m5,r3,r4 and r5

restriction: 
1. RAM must be less than 150GB
2. AMI Linux, Ubuntu n windows
3. ebs must be encrypted, and large
4. only available for on demand and reserve instances
5. hibernate can't be more than 60 days


EBS Volume: (Elastic Block Store)
EBS is attached to AZ (if need on another AZ snapshot is option)
If snapshot is taken as encrypted then copy or volume created would also be encrypted
If snapshot is not encrypted we can copy the snapshot to create new one and choose encrypted option

Delete EBS on termination option is possible.
By default root EBS is enable to delete on termination. Other EBS volumn not.

EBS won't be able to bind to EC2 in different AZ.
Snapshot: EBS retension 1 to 365 days
Snapshot: archive (low prices) - restore takes few hours
Instance Volume - high IOPs but if hardware fails we loose data.

RAID 0 (2 or more EBS volume attached writing either at a time - Increase Performance Enhance)
RAID 1 (2 or more EBS volume attached writing to all of them at a time - Increase Fault tolerance )

EC2 Instance Store - local network drive for fast i/o but risk of lossing if hardware fails (ec2 fails)
- if ec2 stop or terminates instance store will be lost

EFS - Elastic File System
Managed NFS (Network file system) that can be mounted on many EC2 (Network hard drive)

EFS can't be mounted on Windows

Tiers (Lifecyle management feature - move file after n number of days)
1. Standard - For frequently accesses files
2. Infrequent access (EFS - IA) cost to retrieve file - lower price to store - files used not every day

EBS vs EFS

EBS belongs to one instance and same AZ
where as EFS can bind to many ec2 and multi AZ
EBS volume get termianted when EC2 gets terminated (Lossing data)
if EBS needs to be in another AZ  - Take snapshot and restore in another AZ
EFS only works with Linux and Has higher cost than EBS

Snowball:
1. snowball edge - 40 to 80 TB (big device)
2. snowball cone - 8 TB (small device)
3. snowball mobile - PB or ZB data (truck)

GENEVE protocol 6081 - Gateway Load balancer

ALB reserved name: AWSALB, AWSALBAPP, AWSALBTG
ALB and CLB gives static hostname only can have instances, alb, lamda etc as target group
ALB default distribution is cross zone az (equally to instances) , CLB no such feature, NLB default is not enable, need to enable and pay
NLB: gives static hostname as well as static IP - very fast millions req / sec - works on TCP / UDP

SNI(Server name indication): gives feature to add multiple ssl-certs on ALB/NLB


CloudFront:
A static CDN provider from edge location, Great for static content that must be available everywhere, has a ttl

S3 Cross region replication: Great for dynamic content that needs to be available in few region with low latency


Why AWS
1. Iaas (Infrastructure as service)
2. Paas (Platform)
3. Saas (Software)

==========================================================

Databases::
RDS (Managed DB service by AWS)
Aurora is propriety db of aws
aurora supports both mysql and postgres
aurora claims 5x performace than mysql and 3x better to postgres

RDS: read replica - data transfer fee is free within same region but u will pay if read replica is in different region
Multi AZ RDS - sync replicas to slave from master and if master fails slave become master. Still read replica which is Async possible with multi-AZ RDS
Multi AZ will have disaster recovery (DR) and create Slave or Stand by instance (You can read or write from stand by - it will only be use as master once original master fails)

Multi AZ is synchronous where as read replica is Asynchrous
RDS upto 5 read replicas
Aurora upto 15 read replicas + global db + global region read replicas

Just like RDS for cache managed service we have ElasticCache (for redis, memcache etc)

DynamoDB - replication 3 AZ , nosql, serverless, fast, low latency (single digit mili seconds), key-value db
DynamoDB Accesslator (DAX) - memory cached for dynamoDB
Dax is in memory cache for DynamoDB where as elasticCache for other cache tech like redis, memcache etc

Redshift: data warehouse or analyzing Databases (Not a Multi_AZ - enable auto snapshots for disaster recovery)

EMR: Elastic Map Reduce - Hadoop cluster
Athena: Server less search query in s3 object (Anaylyze s3 object)
Amazon QuickSight: to create dashboard, charts, graph, visualization etc

DocumentDB (On the top of MongoDB) - noSQL db
Amazon Neptune: Graph DB

QLDB (Quantum Ledger DB) - book recording financial transactions (centralized ledger)
Amazon Manged Blockchain (de centralized blockchain)
Glue (ETL service - Extract Transform and load)
DMS (Database Migration Service) - used to db migration

==========================================================

ECS( Elastic Container Service - Docker)
Fargate (Also ECS service - serverless dockarion) with no infrastructure to provision (no ec2)
ECR (Elastic Container Registry)  to store docker images on private amazon repo.

API gateway another serverless tech managed service for API CRUD

Serverless technlogies:::
